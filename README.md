This is a mobile-friendly version of the graduation regalia order form used for 
years by the University of Utah Campus Store.

We wanted a touchless option when COVID was at its peak, so people could scan a 
QR code and fill out the order form from their phones (rather than using a shared 
desktop computer, as in years past). 
This is the solution I came up with, based on the existing form.

I also created an order lookup form that populates in real time. It was a great
way for me to practice and learn how to implement asynchronous web development and
AJAX calls.
